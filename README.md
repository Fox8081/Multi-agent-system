# Multi-Agent AI System

A modular, full-stack AI orchestration platform for document analysis, web search, and academic research. Built for internship and research demonstration purposes, it features intelligent query routing and a transparent multi-agent workflow.

**üöÄ Live Demo:** [View on Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Fox8081/Multi-Agent-AI-System)

---

## üß† System Architecture

The platform employs a **multi-agent architecture** with a central **Controller Agent** (Groq LLM-powered). User queries are dynamically routed to one or more specialized agents based on context:

- **PDF RAG Agent:**  
  Handles document Q&A using Retrieval-Augmented Generation and FAISS vector search on user-uploaded PDFs.

- **Web Search Agent:**  
  Provides real-time internet search results for current events and general knowledge.

- **ArXiv Agent:**  
  Fetches, analyzes, and summarizes academic papers from the ArXiv repository.

**Tech Stack:**  
- Backend: **Flask**  
- Frontend: Custom UI: **HTML, CSS, JS**
- LLM API: **Groq**  
- Containerization: **Docker**  
- Deployment: **Hugging Face Spaces**

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Intelligent Agent Routing:**  
  Controller chooses the best agent(s) for each query.

- **Document Analysis:**  
  Upload PDFs and ask context-aware questions.

- **Web & Academic Search:**  
  Integrated web search and scientific paper summarization.

- **Transparent Decisions:**  
  UI displays which agents handled each query and controller's reasoning.

- **Traceability & Logging:**  
  All agent interactions and routing decisions are logged.  
  Access logs via the `/logs` endpoint.

- **Extensible Design:**  
  Modular structure for easy addition of new agents or features.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development & Setup

Clone and run locally in minutes:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fox8081/Multi-agent-system.git
cd Multi-agent-system
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Unix/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 3. Install Python dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add environment variables
- Create a file named `.env` in the root directory.
- Add your Groq API Key (never commit this file!):
  ```
  GROQ_API_KEY="your-secret-key-here"
  ```

### 5. Run the application
```bash
python -m backend.main
```

- The app will be available at: [http://127.0.0.1:5001](http://127.0.0.1:5001)

---

## üö¶ Deployment

The app is containerized for reproducible deployment.
- See [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) for build instructions.
- For cloud deployment, use [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Fox8081/Multi-Agent-AI-System) or Render.
